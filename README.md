How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure that my code is functional by running tests that verify expected outputs. For the Junit tests each method in each class was tested by using parameters that would work and then by using parameters that would not work. When all tests passed this meant that all requirements were met and all the specifics such as allowed lengths of variables and use of unique IDs happened as expected. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

User needs are determined by the requirements given by the client. I incorporate user needs into a program by making sure that all requirements are met. 

How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software by considering all the expected requirements of the program. With this information, I can break the program into pieces that will take care of each requirement. I then write the coding and tests for each of these pieces and verify they work as expected. After verifying that separate parts work, I combine the pieces together and test again to verify functionality.
